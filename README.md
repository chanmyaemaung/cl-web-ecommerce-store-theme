# CL Web Ecommerce Shopify Theme Store v1.0

Welcome to the CL Web Ecommerce Shopify Theme Store v1.0! This Shopify theme store is designed to help you create a beautiful and functional online store quickly and easily.

## Requirements

To use our Shopify theme, you'll need to have the following:

- Node.js 14+
- Shopify CLI latest version (optional if you only want to customize the theme without deploying it)

## Getting Started

To get started with our Shopify theme store, you'll need to have a Shopify account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at [Shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com/).

Once you have your Shopify account set up, you can use the `shopify theme dev --store=your_development_store_url` command to start developing your theme locally.

2. Log in to your Shopify account and go to **Online Store > Themes**.
3. Click on the **Upload theme** button.
4. Select the downloaded theme zip file and upload it.
5. Once uploaded, click on the **Customize** button to start customizing your new theme.

## Features

### Customizing the Theme

You can easily customize the theme by modifying the source code found in the `src` directory. To make changes to the CSS, you can use Tailwind CSS. Simply run the following command to start the Tailwind CSS watcher:

```pnpm tailwind:dev``` or ```npm run tailwind:dev``` or ```yarn tailwind:dev```

This will watch your CSS files for changes and automatically regenerate your Tailwind CSS styles. The generated CSS files are located in the `assets` folder, which is what Shopify uses to render your theme.
